# KuaiRand: An Unbiased Sequential Recommendation Dataset with Randomly Exposed Videos 

[![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-CC%20BY--SA%204.0-green)](https://github.com/chongminggao/KuaiRand/blob/main/LICENSE)

*KuaiRand* is an unbiased sequential recommendation dataset collected from the recommendation logs of the video-sharing mobile app, [Kuaishou (快手)](https://www.kuaishou.com/cn).  **It is the first recommendation dataset with millions of  intervened interactions of randomly exposed items inserted in the standard recommendation feeds!** 


## Overview:

The following figure gives an example of the dataset. It illustrates a user interaction sequence along with the user's rich feedback signals.

![kuaidata](https://cdn.chongminggao.top/figure/KuaiRand-homepage.png)

These feedback signals are collected from the two main user interfaces (UI) in Kuaishou APP shown as follows:

<img src="https://cdn.chongminggao.top/figure/kuaishou-app.png" alt="kuaishou-app" style="display: block;margin: auto;zoom:35%;" />

In the random exposure stage, each recommended video in the dataset has an equal probability being replaced by a random video sampled from an item pools. About $0.37\%$ Interactions are replaced in the final results. 

#### Advantages:

Compared with other datasets with random exposure, KuaiRand has the following advantages:

- ✅ It is the first sequential recommendation dataset with millions of  intervened interactions of randomly exposed items inserted in the standard recommendation feeds.
- ✅ It has the most comprehensive side information including explicit user IDs, interaction timestamps, and rich features for users and items.
- ✅ It has 15 policies with each catered for a special recommendation scenario in Kuaishou App.
- ✅ We introduce 12 feedback signals (e.g., click, like, and view time) for each interaction to describe the user's comprehensive feedback.
- ✅ Each user has thousands of historical interactions on average.
- ✅ It has three versions to support various research directions in recommendation.

## News！
**2022.08.23:** Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) released a series of measures to control cross-border data transfer on July 7, 2022. The full text of the *Measures for Security Assessment of Cross-border Data Transfer (《数据出境安全评估办法》)* can be found [here](http://www.cac.gov.cn/2022-07/07/c_1658811536396503.htm) (currently available only in Mandarin Chinese and there are some English posts such as [this](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2022/08/chinas-cross-border-data-transfer-security-assessment-measures-take-effect-september-1)). The Measures will take effect on September 1, 2022. Therefore, **for now, we cannot provide this dataset to institutions outside China** until CAC completes our assessment and gives us permission to share the data overseas. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.

**2022.08.23:** 国家互联网信息办公室于2022年7月7日出台了保护国家安全及个人隐私的[《数据出境安全评估办法》](http://www.cac.gov.cn/2022-07/07/c_1658811536396503.htm)，于2022年9月1日开始执行。其规定公司数据不能跨境自由流动。于是我们按照规定中止对国外机构提供该数据集，**目前仅能将该数据提供给中国境内机构使用**。在国家互联网信息办公室批准我们的数据出境请求后，我们将马上向所有人公开该数据。

**2022.08.02:** Our CIKM '22 paper is accepted.

**2022.06.02:** The paper introducing this dataset is submitted to CIKM '22 Resource Track.

## Download the data:
Due to regulations of the Chinese government (as mentioned above), for now, we have to use email to make sure that you are a researcher or practitioner in China. Then you have to sign some files to promise that you will NOT disclose this dataset. Please send us your *name*, *institution* (which must lie in China) via this email address: kuairand@gmail.com

We are very sorry for the inconvenience! We will try to overcome this problem soon.

根据国家最近出台的个人隐私信息保护法以及数据出境安全评估办法，我们目前只提供数据集给中国机构（大学、研究所、公司），且需要您将您的*姓名*、*机构信息*发给我方，我们将回复您相关的保密协议。在签署协议后，才能给您发送本数据集。联系邮箱：kuairand@gmail.com

## Three Versions and Suggestions:

We release three versions of KuaiRand for different usage:

- **KuaiRand-27K (23GB logs +23GB features):** the complete KuaiRand dataset that has over 27K users and 32 millions videos.
- **KuaiRand-1K  (829MB logs + 3.5GB features):** randomly sample 1,000 users from *KuaiRand-27K*, then remove all irrelevant videos. There are 4 millions videos rest. 
- **KuaiRand-Pure  (184MB logs + 10MB features):** only keeps the logs for the 7583 videos in the candidate pool. 

The *user_id* and *video_id* are re-indexed. A visualization of their ID spaces is shown as follows.

##### The basic statistics of the three versions are summarized as follows:

|                  |   Random policy    | 27,285 | 7,583 | 1,186,059 | 30             | 62            | 12 signals    | ✔️ |


### Which version should I use?

- ##### Reasons to use *KuaiRand-27K* or *KuaiRand-1K*:

  - Your research needs rigorous sequential logs, such as off-policy evaluation (OPE), Reinforcement learning (RL), or long sequential recommendation.

- ##### Reasons to use *KuaiRand-Pure*:

  - The sequential information is not necessary in your research OR If you are OK with the incomplete sequential logs. For example, if you are studying debiasing in collaborative filtering models or multi-task modeling in recommendation.
  - If your model can only run with small-size data.

####  1️⃣ Descriptions of the fields in `log_xxx.csv` 

There are three log files:

- `log_random_4_22_to_5_08.csv` contains all interactions resulted from random intervention.
- `log_standard_4_22_to_5_08.csv` contains all interactions of standard recommendation.
- `log_standard_4_08_to_4_21.csv` contains all interactions of standard recommendation for the same users in the previous two weeks (2022.04.08 ~ 2022.04.21).
