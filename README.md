# KuaiRand: An Unbiased Sequential Recommendation Dataset with Randomly Exposed Videos 

[![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-CC%20BY--SA%204.0-green)](https://github.com/chongminggao/KuaiRand/blob/main/LICENSE)

*KuaiRand* is an unbiased sequential recommendation dataset collected from the recommendation logs of the video-sharing mobile app, [Kuaishou (快手)](https://www.kuaishou.com/cn).  **It is the first recommendation dataset with millions of  intervened interactions of randomly exposed items inserted in the standard recommendation feeds!** 


## Overview:

The following figure gives an example of the dataset. It illustrates a user interaction sequence along with the user's rich feedback signals.

![kuaidata](https://cdn.chongminggao.top/figure/KuaiRand-homepage.png)

These feedback signals are collected from the two main user interfaces (UI) in Kuaishou APP shown as follows:

<img src="https://cdn.chongminggao.top/figure/kuaishou-app.png" alt="kuaishou-app" style="display: block;margin: auto;zoom:35%;" />

In the random exposure stage, each recommended video in the dataset has an equal probability being replaced by a random video sampled from an item pools. About $0.37\%$ Interactions are replaced in the final results. 

#### Advantages:

Compared with other datasets with random exposure, KuaiRand has the following advantages:

- ✅ It is the first sequential recommendation dataset with millions of  intervened interactions of randomly exposed items inserted in the standard recommendation feeds.
- ✅ It has the most comprehensive side information including explicit user IDs, interaction timestamps, and rich features for users and items.
- ✅ It has 15 policies with each catered for a special recommendation scenario in Kuaishou App.
- ✅ We introduce 12 feedback signals (e.g., click, like, and view time) for each interaction to describe the user's comprehensive feedback.
- ✅ Each user has thousands of historical interactions on average.
- ✅ It has three versions to support various research directions in recommendation.

## News！
**2022.08.23 😫:** Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) released a very tight implementation schedule to forbid cross-border data transfer on July 7, 2022. The full text of the *Measures for Security Assessment of Cross-border Data Transfer (《数据出境安全评估办法》)* can be found [here](http://www.cac.gov.cn/2022-07/07/c_1658811536396503.htm) (currently available only in Mandarin Chinese). The Measures will take effect on September 1, 2022. Therefore, **for now, we cannot provide this dataset to institutions outside China** until the legal department of the Kuaishou company passes the security assessment. We sincerely appologize and we will try our best to address this issue.

**2022.08.23 😫:** 国家互联网信息办公室于2022年7月7日出台了非常严格的[《数据出境安全评估办法》](http://www.cac.gov.cn/2022-07/07/c_1658811536396503.htm)，于2022年9月1日开始执行。其规定公司数据不能跨境自由流动。于是我们不得已中止对国外机构提供该数据集。**目前仅能将该数据提供给中国境内机构使用**。对此，我们非常无奈，也非常抱歉。当快手公司的法务部解决这一问题后，我们将马上向所有人公开该数据。

## Download the data:

Due to tight regulations of the Chinese government (as mentioned above), we have to use email to make sure that you are a researcher or practitioner in China. Then you have to sign some files to promise that you will NOT disclose this dataset. 

Please send us your *name*, *institution* (which must lie in China) via this email address: kuairand@gmail.com

We are very sorry for the inconvenience! 😭 We will try to overcome this problem soon.

由于国家最近出台的个人隐私信息保护法，公司法务部决定，目前只提供数据集给中国机构（大学、研究所、公司），且需要您将您的*姓名*、*机构信息*发给我方，我们将回复您一份协议。在签署协议后，才能给您发送本数据集。非常抱歉，这已经是我们能做出的最大努力了😭。联系邮箱：kuairand@gmail.com。

## Three Versions and Suggestions:

We release three versions of KuaiRand for different usage:

- **KuaiRand-27K (23GB logs +23GB features):** the complete KuaiRand dataset that has over 27K users and 32 millions videos.
- **KuaiRand-1K  (829MB logs + 3.5GB features):** randomly sample 1,000 users from *KuaiRand-27K*, then remove all irrelevant videos. There are 4 millions videos rest. 
- **KuaiRand-Pure  (184MB logs + 10MB features):** only keeps the logs for the 7583 videos in the candidate pool. 

The *user_id* and *video_id* are re-indexed. A visualization of their ID spaces is shown as follows.

##### The basic statistics of the three versions are summarized as follows:

### Which version should I use?

- ##### Reasons to use *KuaiRand-27K* or *KuaiRand-1K*:

  - Your research needs rigorous sequential logs, such as off-policy evaluation (OPE), Reinforcement learning (RL), or long sequential recommendation.

- ##### Reasons to use *KuaiRand-Pure*:

  - The sequential information is not necessary in your research OR If you are OK with the incomplete sequential logs. For example, if you are studying debiasing in collaborative filtering models or multi-task modeling in recommendation.
  - If your model can only run with small-size data.

####  1️⃣ Descriptions of the fields in `log_xxx.csv` 

There are three log files:

- `log_random_4_22_to_5_08.csv` contains all interactions resulted from random intervention.
- `log_standard_4_22_to_5_08.csv` contains all interactions of standard recommendation.
